###Usage:
 0. Create a backup of the game.win or game.unx file in your vallhalla game directory


 1. Download the undertale mod tool


 2. Open the game.win/game.unx file inside the vallhalla game directory with the undertale mod tool


 3. Under "Repack assets" in the "scripts" dropdown select "ImportGML.csx"


 4. Navigate to the location of the .gml files provided alongside this text file in the "fixes" directory and select them


 OPTIONAL: repeat steps 3 and 4 with the "bigdrink" directory if you want to install those changes too


  5. Under the File dropdown select "Save" and select the game.win/game.unx file in the vallhalla directory and select "yes" to overwrite the file


 6. If you want to install the script fixes overwrite the files in your vallhalla game directory with those provided in the "scrips"directory


 NOTE: The script fixes are extremely minor, the changes to day 11 don't effect anything as far as i can tell, the changes to day 12 allow for a single line of dialouge from jill to show



If at any time during this process you mess up, or you just wish to revert to the vanilla game files, you may either


 A: delete the modified game.win or game.unix file and replace it with the backup you created (you made a backup, right?)


 B: right click the game in your steam library, click properties, click local files then click "verify integrity of game files" which will tell steam to redownload any modified or missing files
