### Fixed:


 The taste of a Piano Man is "Bitter" instead of "bitter".


When a Piano Woman is mixed as the second drink, its taste is "Sweet" instead of "sweet".


The taste of a big Crevice Spike is "ssour" instead of "sour".


Mixing two drinks when requested by a client will reset the total amount of money earnt that day


Serving two drinks with the first being correct and the second being incorrect will not result in the amount of money you have earned increasing


Day 1:


Donovan will always ask you to give them a beer this time regardless of whether or not you have messed up the previous order(s)


Day 7:


Serving a drink with high alchohol content to art when requested not triggering related dialouge


Day 11:


Making two Fringe Weavers instead of one Fringe Weaver and one Bloom Light does not trigger related dialouge


Day 12:


The "big drink" $100 bonus is sometimes awarded when the drink is small.


NOTE: the fix for this is contained within the bigdrink folder due to the impact it will have on the amount of money you can gain in a day
